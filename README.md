# Optimizing Pathfinding

Demo: [youtube link](https://youtu.be/DwQp7BPeTSQ)

In this project, I worked on the AStar file

The AStar code essentially finds the shortest path between a start and goal point in a game world using a priority queue to efficiently manage checking nodes based on their total cost, i.e. the sum of the actual cost from the start node and a heuristic estimate to the goal.
